# Lab3---PONG
Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 4 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. 

We use an Arduino UNO (ATmega 328p) and LCD screen to build this pong game. There are three modes, the game can be played with two human players using touchscreen, or one player using touchscreen against a computer controlled paddle, or one player adjust the horizontal angle using accelerometer against a computer.

We also include some fine-like features. There is a buzzer generating sounds each time when the ball hits something, and the backlight turns red when one player loses.
